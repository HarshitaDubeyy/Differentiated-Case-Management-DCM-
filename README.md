# NyaayPortal CaseBot

NyaayPortal introduces CaseBot, an AI-powered assistant designed to implement Differentiated Case Flow Management (DCM) on the website. Nyaay Portal aims to assist judges in handling cases more efficiently and fairly.

## Overview
Nyaay Portal utilizes CaseBot, an intelligent computer system that follows the DCM approach to organize cases. CaseBot considers factors such as filing date, case type, nature of the offense, and urgency to prioritize cases effectively.


## Key Features

- **Case Prioritization**: The software evaluates the complexity and urgency of each case to determine its priority level.
- **Smart Scheduling**: Cases are scheduled intelligently, ensuring that complex cases receive adequate time and attention while simpler cases are expedited.
- **Backlog Reduction**: By prioritizing cases effectively, the software helps reduce backlogs and ensures a smoother workflow for judges and legal professionals.
- **Fair Treatment**: DCM ensures that all cases are treated fairly, regardless of their nature or complexity, leading to a more equitable judicial process.
- **Faster Justice Delivery**: By optimizing case scheduling and management, the software facilitates faster resolution of legal disputes, ensuring timely justice for all parties involved.

## How It Works

1. **Case Evaluation**: Each case is evaluated based on factors such as complexity, urgency, and priority.
2. **Priority Assignment**: The software assigns priority levels to cases, ensuring that the most critical cases receive immediate attention.
3. **Scheduling Optimization**: Cases are scheduled in a way that maximizes judicial resources and minimizes delays.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Judges and legal professionals can access real-time updates on case listings and status changes.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: The software includes tools for monitoring performance metrics and identifying areas for improvement.
